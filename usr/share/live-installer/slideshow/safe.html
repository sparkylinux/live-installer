        <p>SparkyLinux lets you choose how you'd like to update your system.</p>
        <p>System Upgrade tool providing as easy as possible (recommended) way to keep your Sparky installation up-to-date.</p>
	<p>If you prefer to do that in you way, simply use our another tool called Sparky APTus which lets you make system upgrade, clean up and perform many other operations on the system in a manual way.</p>
	<p>Synaptic is also preinstalled if you'd like to use it instead of Sparky tools.</p>
        <p>We also use our own repository to offer the latest versions of our applications.</p>
